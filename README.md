**univertex** is a high-performance, singleton-based graph library designed for efficient graph operations and analysis.

## Features

➝ Singleton design ensures a single, globally accessible graph instance  
➝ Efficient memory management of pull of 1MB size for tinkering your control over instances  
➝ Make use of algorithms such as BFS and DFS scanning your graph  
➝ Flexible node and edge management with dynamic addition and removal via CLI (coming soon)  
➝ Optimized for performance in both time and space complexity  
➝ 3D-rendering with rotating capabilities for intuitive graph exploration

## Performance
**univertex** is designed with performance in mind: O(1) node lookup and edge insertion, O(n) for graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) and efficient memory usage with smart pointers and optimized data structures
